# Homework debrief

Ask **two questions** about the concepts


---

# Prediction and explanation

- Unlike political scientists who try to forecast elections, sociologists are 
rarely trying to predict future events

- The prediction weâ€™re generally interested in is prediction of patterns 
outside the sample (i.e., **generalization**)

- **Out-of-sample prediction** is a stronger test of understanding than in-sample prediction

# 1. Review of correlation

---

# Correlation (Pearson's _r_ )

$~$

$$r = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum^n_{i=1} \left( \frac{x_i-\bar{x}}{S_x}\times\frac{y_i-\bar{y}}{S_y} \right)$$

$~$

In other words, it's the average of the product of two variables' z-scores. It's a measure of how strongly two variables are associated.

---

# Correlation

- On average, how do two variables move together

- Positive (negative) correlation: When x is larger than its mean, y is likely (unlikely) to be larger than its mean

- Positive (negative) correlation: data cloud slopes up (down)

- High correlation: data cluster tightly around a line

---

# Visualizing different correlations

# make a function that makes fake data with a given correlation

  result <- 
    MASS::mvrnorm(n, 
                  mu = c(0,0), 
                  Sigma = matrix(c(1,r, r,1) , 
                            nrow = 2 ,
                            dimnames = list(c("y","x"))) ) %>% 
    as_tibble() %>% 
    mutate( corr = r )
  return( result )
}

# for reproducibility
set.seed(0903)

# make four different versions
cdata <- bind_rows( mkdata( 1000 ,  0 ) ,
                    mkdata( 1000 , .3 ) ,
                    mkdata( 1000 , .6 ) ,
                    mkdata( 1000 , .9 ))

# plot the result
ggplot( cdata , aes( x = x, y = y )) +
  geom_point( alpha = .3 ) +

# Linear regression model

| $Y$ | outcome variable |
| $X$ | predictor variable |
| $\alpha$, $\beta$ | parameters of the model |
| $\varepsilon$ | unobserved random error |
| | |
| $\alpha+\beta X$ | expected mean of $Y$ given a value of $X$  |
| $\alpha$ | expected value of $Y$ when $X=0$ |
| $\beta$ | expected change in $Y$ given 1-unit increase in $X$ |

From 370 pieces of information (185 $\times$ 2) to just two pieces: **slope** and 
**intercept**

So what's a good guess for a country with a life expectancy of 80 years?

--

.center[The answer is **2**!]

---

# Why _this_ line?

### Estimate the model parameters from the data
$(\hat{\alpha},\hat{\beta})$ are estimated coefficients <br>
$\hat{Y} = \hat{\alpha}+\hat{\beta}X$ are fitted/predicted values <br>
$\hat{\varepsilon} = Y - \hat{Y}$ are estimated residuals

### We obtain these estimates via least squares

That is, minimizing $SSR = \sum\hat{\varepsilon_i}^2$ or $RMSE= \sqrt{\frac{SSR}{n}}$

---

# Some algebra for least squares

### Estimated coefficients in mathematical expressions:

$$\hat{\beta} = \frac{\sum(Y_i - \bar{Y}) (X_i - \bar{X})} {\sum(X_i - \bar{X})^2}$$

$$\hat{\alpha} = \bar{Y} - \hat{\beta}\bar{X} $$

--

### Relationship between slope and correlation

$$\hat{\beta} = corr(Y,X) \times \frac{S_y}{S_x} $$

---

# How well does the model fit?

### In other words, how well does it predict the outcome?

$~$

$$R^2 = 1 - \frac{SSR}{TSS} = 1-\frac{\sum \hat{\varepsilon}_i^2}{\sum(Y_i - \bar{Y})}$$

.footnote[This is the correlation coefficient (_r_) squared. Here's that's about
-.76 so the square is .58. You could say "differences in life expectancy account
for 58% of the variance in fertility." But remember, this is **descriptive**, not **causal**.]

# Galton and regression to the mean

The correlation between parent and child's height is about .46 in Galton's 
data. The mean height is (about) 69 inches (5'9"). If a man is 79 inches tall 
(6'7"), how tall can he expect his male children to be? What about his male 
grandchildren?

--

**Children** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $69 + 10\times.46 \approx 73.6$ inches
(almost 6'2")

--

**Grandchildren**  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $69 + 10\times.46^2 \approx 71.1$ 
inches (about 5'11")

--

In other words, you get to "keep" about $r \times 100$ percent of your "above-
averageness" at each generation.

Galton multiplied female heights by 1.08 to make them comparable
