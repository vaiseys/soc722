# Sociology 722

This is my attempt to convert my first-semester graduate stats course from 
PowerPoint to HTML5 slides. I started using ioslides for the first two lectures
but then switched to [xaringan](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan). I will
eventually go back and redo the first two but I'm going to keep pressing 
forward.

The course is based on Kosuke Imai's *Quantitative Social Science: An Introduction*. 
I draw pretty heavily on his slides sometimes.
